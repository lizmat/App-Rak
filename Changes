Revision history for App-Rak

{{$NEXT}}
     - Ignore --progress if STDERR is not a tty.  This allows
       --progress to be used as a default
     - Ignore --progress with --edit option, as the editing can
       actually be part of the lazy searching, and you don't
       want the announcer running while editing a file

       a single source file was found
     - Add support for --progress option, writing search result
       progress to STDERR
     - The --unique option will now sort the result using
       foldcase logic
     - Update help on --only-first: the default is 1000, not 1
     - Stats output is now done on STDERR instead of STDOUT,
       as it's not really part of the result
     - Update copyright year

0.2.23  2024-05-09T13:51:24+02:00

       the string.  This looks like it is the most useful functionality

     - Added some basic --csv-per-line author tests
     - Fix issue with --type= information not being authoritative,
       spotted by Márton Polgár

     - Add "is-text" option to indicate selecting files with text
       rather than with binary data.  Made that also the default
       rather than --known-extensions.  Can specify --/is-text to
       select files with binary data, but that only makes sense
       when --find is also specified for now.  Refuse to search
       binary files otherwise (at least for now).
