--backup[=extension]

Only makes sense when the --modify-files is also specified.  Indicates
whether backups should be made when a file is modified.  If an extension
is specified, then that will be added to the name of the file.  If
specified as a flag, then ".bak" will be assumed.  Defaults to not
making any backup.

--dry-run

Only makes sense when either the --modify-files or --rename-files is
also specified.  Indicates that *no* actual changes should be performed.
Defaults to False, allowing for changes to be made.

--modify-files

Only makes sense with a Callable pattern.  Indicates that the inspected
files may be potentially changed.  If the value returned by the
Callable pattern is not True/False/Nil/Empty and different from the
given line, then that line will be replaced by the returned value(s).
Else it will be kept unchanged because of an implicit --passthru-context
argument being active.  Defaults to False, indicating that files
should **not** be changed.  Can also specify --dry-run to see which
files would be changed without actually making any changes.

--rename-files

Only makes sense with a Callable pattern.  Assumes --find semantics
if specified.  Indicates that the names of the selected files may be
potentially changed.  If the value returned by the Callable pattern
is not True/False/Nil/Empty and different from the given filename,
then the name of the file will be replaced by the returned value.
Defaults to False, indicating that no files will be renamed.  If
the file is under version control (currently only "git" is supported)
will make sure that the version control system will be aware of
the rename.  Can also specify --dry-run to see which files would be
renamed without actually making any changes.
