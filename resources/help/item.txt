Item producers:
‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒

These arguments determine the items that will be presented to the
pattern matcher.

--per-line[=producer]

Produce the lines of text for each selected file.  Can be specified as
a flag (which is actually the default behaviour if no other producer
has been specified).  Can also be specified as a Callable pattern, which
is then responsible for producing lines to be presented to the pattern
matcher.

Examples:
# look for "foo" in all files with known extensions from current directory
# and show each line that has "foo" in it
$ rak foo

# look for "foo" only in the last 10 lines of each file and show each line
# that has "foo" in it
$ rak --per-line='*.lines.head(10)' foo

--per-file[=producer]

Produce the whole file to the pattern matcher.  Can be specified as a
flag.  Can also be specified as a Callable pattern, which is then
responsible for producing the content to be presented to the matcher.

Examples:
# all names of files that have the string "foo" in them
$ rak --per-file --files-with-matches foo

--find

Produce the paths from the haystack specification and the filesystem
filters as items for matching.  A Callable pattern will be presented
with an IO::Path object, other matching uses the absolute path.

Examples:
# all paths that contain "special" in their name
$ rak --find special

# number of files with "special" in their name
$ rak --find special --count-only

# all paths of which basename starts with an "f"
$ rak --find '*.basename.starts-with("f")'

# all basenames and their frequencies of which the basename
# starts with an "f"
$ rak --find '{ .basename if .basename.starts-with("f")}' --frequencies

--json-per-file

Attempt to parse the whole file as JSON.  If parsing is successful,
pass the obtained data-structure as an item to the pattern matcher.
Only files with an extension from the #json extension group will be
tried, unless overridden by any explicit extension specification.

Example:
# Produce the unique "name" fields of which the "auth" field starts
# with "zef:" (basically all modules in the zef ecosystem) of all
# .json files that can be found in the REA/main directory and its
# subdirectories.
$ rak --json-per-file '{ .<name> if .<auth> ~~ /^zef:/ }' --unique REA/meta

--json-per-elem

Attempt to parse the whole files as JSON.  If parsing is successful,
pass all top-level elements of the data-structure as items to the
pattern matcher.  Only files with an extension from the #json
extension group will be tried, unless overridden by any explicit
extension specification.

Example:
# Produce the unique "name" fields of which the "auth" field starts
# with "zef:" (basically all modules in the zef ecosystem) from the
# REA/META.json file containing all meta information of the Raku
# Ecosystem Archive.
$ rak --json-per-elem '{.<name> if .<auth> ~~ /^zef:/}' --unique REA/META.json

--json-per-line

Attempt to parse each line in the file as JSON.  If parsing is
successful, pass the obtained data-structure as an item to the
pattern matcher.  Only files with an extension from the #jsonl
extension group will be tried, unless overridden by any explicit
extension specification.

--blame-per-file

Attempt to obtain "git blame" information of the file as a Git::Blame::File
object.  If successful, pass the Git::Blame::File object as an item to
the pattern matcher.  Only looks at files that are under version control
(as if --under-version-control has been specified).

These methods can be called on the object passed to the pattern Callable:
- commits  Map of commits, key is SHA1, value if Git::Blame::Commit object
- authors  list of unique authors

These methods can be called on the Git::Blame::Commit object:
- author             the name of the author
- author-mail        the email address of the author
- author-time        a DateTime object for the authoring
- commit             the associated Git::Blame::Commit object
- committed          whether it has been committed already
- committer          the name of the committer
- committer-mail     the email address of the committer
- committer-time     a DateTime object for the committing
- previous-sha1      the full SHA1 of the previous commit
- previous-sha       the shortened SHA1 of the previous commit
- previous-filename  the filename in the previous commit
- sha1               full SHA1 of the commit to which this line belongs
- sha                shortened SHA1 of the commit to which this line belongs
- summary            the first line of the commit message of this line

Examples:
# produce the committers in a repository
$ rak --blame-per-file '*.authors.Slip' --unique

# produce files with more than one commit and number of commits
$ rak --blame-per-file '{ .commits.Int if .commits > 1 }'

Requires that the Git::Blame::File module is installed.

https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Git::Blame::File .

--blame-per-line

Attempt to obtain "git blame" information of the file as a Git::Blame::File
object.  If successful, produce each line as a Git::Blame::Line item to the
pattern matcher.  Only looks at files that are under version control
(as if --under-version-control has been specified).

Apart from the methods that can be called on the Git::Blame::Commit
object (see above), these additional methods can be called on the object
passed to the pattern matcher:
- commit                the associated Git::Blame::Commit object
- filename              the current filename
- line                  the actual line currently
- line-number           the current line-number
- original-line-number  line number when this line was created

Requires that the Git::Blame::File module is installed.

https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Git::Blame::File .

--csv-per-line

Attempt to interprete file as a CSV file, and pass each row as an item
to the pattern matchere.  Only files with extensions from the #csv group
will be tried, unless overridden by any explicit extension specification.

The following options only make sense when --csv-per-line has been specified:
- --allow-loose-escapes  flag, allow any character to be escaped
- --allow-loose-quotes   flag, allow unquoted fields
- --allow-whitespace     flag, allow whitespace around separator
- --auto-diag            flag, show diagnostics (default: true)
- --eol=[\n|\r|\r\n]     different line ending to assume
- --escape=[\\]          escape character, default \  (shell requires \\)
- --formula=[type]       none | die | diag | empty, default: none
- --quote=["]            quoting char, default: "
- --sep=[,]              field separator, default: ,
- --strict               flag, do not allow different number of fields
- --keep-meta            flag, produce fields as CSV::Field instead of Str

Example:
# Show the values of the first column of the rows in the "info.csv" file
# if the second column is equal to "foo"
$ rak --csv-per-line '{.[0] if .[1] eq "foo"}' info.csv

Requires that the Text::CSV module is installed.

https://raku.land/github:Tux/Text::CSV .

--unicode

Produce the names of all Unicode defined codepoints (built into Raku)
and pass these to the pattern matcher.  Shows matched codepoint values
in hexadecimal, the full name and the actual character.

Example:
# show all codepoints that have "banknote" in their name
$ rak --unicode banknote
1F4B4 BANKNOTE WITH YEN SIGN 💴
1F4B5 BANKNOTE WITH DOLLAR SIGN 💵
1F4B6 BANKNOTE WITH EURO SIGN 💶
1F4B7 BANKNOTE WITH POUND SIGN 💷
