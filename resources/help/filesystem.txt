File system filters:

File system filters refine the inital selection of files as indicated by
the haystack arguments.

Refining by name:

These arguments partially overlap in functionality.  If none of these
arguments are specified, then --dir (accepting *all* directories for
recursion) and --known-extensions (accepting only files of which the
extension is an extension of any of the predefined extension groups).

--dir=expression

Specifies the expression (either as a string, regular expression or as
a Callable) that will be matched with the basename of a directory.
This expression should return True to have a subdirectory be included
for recursion.  Defaults to any directory of which the basename does
**NOT** start with a period.  Specifying --dir as a flag will include
*all* subdirectories, while specifying --/dir (or --not-dir) will
cause no recursion to happen whatsoever (this can be handy when only
interested in the files of the current directory).

--extensions=list

Specifies the extensions that a filename should have, to be accepted.
Can either be a single extension (group), or a comma-separated list
of extensions (groups).  Currently the predefined extension groups
are: #raku, #perl, #cro, #text, #c, #c++, #yaml, #ruby, #python,
#html, #markdown, #json, #jsonl, #csv, #config and #text.  Conflicts
with --file, --find-all or --known-extensions.

--file=expression

Specifies the expression (either as a string, regular expression or
as a Callable) that will be matched with the basename of a file.
This expression should return True to have a file be included.
Conflicts with --extensions, --find-all or --known-extensions.

--find-all

Flag.  If specified with a True value, will set --dir and --file both
to True, indicating *no* limitation on which directories are acceptable
for recursion, nor any limitation on the basename of a file.  Conflicts
with --file, --dir, --extensions or --known-extensions.

--known-extensions

Flag.  If specified with a True value, will only accept files of which
the extension is an extension of any of the predefined extension groups.
Conflicts with --file, --find-all or --extensions.

Refining by epoch:

These arguments expect a Callable that will be given the associated
epoch value of the file being checked.  See
https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/App::Rak#checking-times-on-files for
more information about possible features.

--accessed=condition  Check on epoch when file was last accessed
--created=condition   Check on epoch when file was created
--meta-modified=cond  Check on epoch when meta-info of file was last changed
--modified=condition  Check on epoch when file was last changed

Refining by user / group name:

These arguments either expect a Callable that will be given a string
associated with the file, which is expected to return True to accept
the file.  Or it may consist of a comma-separated list of names of
acceptable names, optionally prefixed with an exclamation mark to
indicate that the specified names are unacceptable.

--user=selector   File is owned by user names / expression
--group=selector  File is owned by group names / expression

Refining by user / group ID:

These arguments expect a Callable that will be given a numeric ID
associated with the owner of file.  It is expected to return True
to have the file accepted.  Note that this may actually only work
on Unixy file systems.

--uid=condition  File is owned by uid given
--gid=condition  File is owned by gid given

Refining by numeric meta value:

These arguments expect a Callable (except --is-empty) that will be
given the associated numeric value, and which should return True
to have the file in question being accepted.

--blocks=condition    Number of file system blocks used by file
--device-number=cond  Number of device on which file is located
--filesize=condition  Number of bytes of data used by file
--is-empty            Number of bytes of data used by file is zero
--hard-links=cond     Number of hard-links to file on file system
--inode=condition     Inode number of file on file system
--mode=condition      The full mode value of the file

Refining by external program:

These arguments can be used to accept a file if an external
program (either direct or through a shell) will successfully
run to completion when given the full path of the filename
being inspected.  The filename is available as $_ in the
expression that you give.

--exec=program  Run program, include if successful
--shell=action  Run shell command, include if successful

Refining by attribute (not) being set:

These arguments can be both specified with a True value
(e.g. --is-readable) or with a False value (--/is-readable or
--no-is-readable).  If specified with a True value, will accept
a file if that attribute is set.  If specified with a False value,
will accept a file if that attribute is **NOT** set.  Note that
some of these attributes will actually only work on Unixy
file systems.

--has-setgid           Has SETGID bit (not) set in attributes
--has-setuid           Has SETUID bit (not) set in attributes
--is-executable        File can (not) be executed by owner
--is-readable          File can (not) be read by owner
--is-writable          File can (not) be written to by owner
--is-group-executable  File can (not) be executed by group members of owner
--is-group-readable    File can (not) be read by group members of owner
--is-group-writable    File can (not) be written to by group members of owner
--is-owned-by-group    File is (not) owned by group of user
--is-owned-by-user     File is (not) owned by user
--is-symbolic-link     File is (not) a symbolic link
--is-sticky            Has STICKY bit (not) set in attributes
--is-world-executable  File can (not) be executed by anybody
--is-world-readable    File can (not) be read by anybody
--is-world-writable    File can (not) be written to by anybody
