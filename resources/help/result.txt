Result modifiers:
‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒

These options alter the way a search result is processed and shown.
Many combinations of these options may or may not make sense.

--after-context=N

Also produce N items after any item with a match.  Defaults to *no*
items after any item with a match.

--before-context=N

Also produce N items before any item with a match.  Defaults to *no*
items before any item with a match.

--categorize=categorizer

If specified, indicates the Callable that should return zero or more
keysfor a given line to have it categorized.  This effectively replaces
the filename if a line by its key in the result.  See also --classify.

Example:
# categorize by the first two letters of a line
$ rak --categorize='*.substr(0,2).comb'


--classify=classifier

If specified, indicates the Callable that should return a key for a
given line to have it classified.  This effectively replaces the filename
if a line by its key in the result.  See also --categorize.

Example:
# classify by the last letter of a line
$ rak --classify='*.substr(*-1)'

--context=N

Also produce N items before and after any item with a match.
Defaults to *no* items before or after a match.

--count-only

When specified with a true value, will **ONLY** produce result counts.

--files-with-matches

Produce only the names of files *with* matches.  By default, will
return full result information.

--files-without-matches

Produce only the names of files *without* matches.  By default, will
return full result information.

--frequencies

Create a Bag of the search result and produce the contents of the Bag
in decreasing frequency.  Usually used in conjunction with a Callable
pattern that produces a string, or with --matches-only.

--invert-match

Invert the meaning of matching, producing items that did *not* match.

--matches-only

Only produce the actual matches, instead of the items that matched.
Usually used in conjunction with --unique or --frequencies.

--max-matches-per-file=N

Specify the maximum number of matches that should be produced per
file.  If not specified, will produce all possible matches of a file.

--paragraph-context

Also produce all items before and after any matched item if they are
in the same paragraph.  A paragraph being defined as the items between
two items that stringify to the empty string.

--passthru

Always produce all items.

--passthru-context

Produce all items of a file if there was at least one match.

--stats-only

When specified with a true value, will **ONLY** produce statistics.
See also --stats.

--unique
